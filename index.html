                             Computers have always fascinated me, 
                             and I love figuring out how they work and what we can do with them. In my free time I like to play some soccer,

                            my passion for soccer has been a constant presence in my life. 
                            From kicking a ball around the neighborhood streets to competing in organized matches, 
                            soccer has always been my escape and my joy. Despite the demands of my academic pursuits, 
                            I find solace and fulfillment on the soccer field. The strategic thinking and teamwork required in soccer 
                            complement my analytical mindset cultivated in computer science. Soccer serves as a balance to my studies, providing me with invaluable lessons in leadership, perseverance,
                             and teamwork that extend far beyond the confines of the field.</p>
